## Job description
Please create an lwc component that can be added to any record page. Name this component “Child Auditor” – please look at the picture below.

Business logic:

2)	Also, the current amount of object records should be displayed next to each child object name.
3)	The component should have a button named "Refresh" to refresh component data immediately.
